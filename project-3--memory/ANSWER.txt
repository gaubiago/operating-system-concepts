a) Are the files in your program sharing the same memory region?

I ran numerous tests, with various sizes of input files, trying to 
understand whether the files were sharing the same memory. For every
different size of input file, I ran the code with the memcpy() part and 
without the memcpy() part. With memcpy(), I was able to find
the content inside the output file, and withouth memcpy() noticed that 
the file had null bytes all over although it had the same size as the input 
file. That way, I found out that for every test I ran, the files were not 
sharing the same memory region.

b) Should they? Justify your answer.

No, the two files should not share the same memory. Let's take an example in 
which we have an input and an output file, and instead of copying the data
straight from one file to another, we want to transform the data read before
writing it to the output file. In that case, if both files had the same memory
region, the new data to be written to the output file would corrupt the
content of the input file.
